# Coding Challenge - 005 : Create Phonebook Application

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a program that creates a phonebook and performs certain operations on the phonebook.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- design, implement `for` and `while` loops effectively in Python to solve the given problem.

- control loops effectively by using `if` and `control` statements.

- demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using function effectively.

- apply exception handling to handle errors effectively.

## Problem Statement

- Write a program that creates a phonebook, adds requested contacts to the phonebook, finds them, and removes them.

- There should be 4 options available to the user and from the options, users should be able to add, find, delete contacts, or terminate the program as shown below.

- Phonebook has users and their corresponding phone numbers.

- At the beginning of the program the phonebook will be empty and user can choose to add new contacts to the phonebook.

- Program should ask user for the input, after giving information text shown as below.

```text
Welcome to the phonebook application
1. Find phone number
2. Insert a phone number
3. Delete a person from the phonebook
4. Terminate
Select operation on Phonebook App (1/2/3) :
```

- Application should be case sensitive and run until the user types `4`.

- Example for user inputs and respective outputs
