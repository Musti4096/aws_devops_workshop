# Coding Challenge 004 : Validate Combination of Brackets

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to solve a combination problem using loops.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- understand the use of loops.
- solve the advanced and complicated problems.
- understand the importance of pattern recognition.
- get a better understanding in manipulating lists or strings.

## Problem Statement
  
- Write a function that given a string containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determines if the input string is valid or not by using following rules.

- An input string is valid if:

  - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

  - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

- Example for user inputs and respective outputs

```text
Input           Output
------------    ------
"()"            true
"()[]{}"        true
"(]"            false
"([)]"          false
"{[]}"          true
""              true
```
