# Coding Challenge - 006: Generate Password

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program that creates a random password from a given full name.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Execute operations on strings.

- Make use of random numbers to solve a problem.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter his/her full name (without any spaces) and then creates a secret password consisting of three letters (in lowercase) randomly picked up from his/her full name, and a random four-digit number. For example, if the user enters "JackClarusway", a secret password can probably be one of "jcs1578" or "yka8832" or "awu1250".
