  - Connect to your instance with SSH.

    ```bash
    ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    ```

  - Enter the temporary password to unlock the Jenkins.

  - Install suggested plugins.

  - Create first admin user (`call-jenkins:Call-jenkins1234`).

  - Check the URL, then save and finish the installation.

  - Open your Jenkins dashboard and navigate to `Manage Jenkins` >> `Manage Plugins` >> `Available` tab

  - Search and select `GitHub Integration` plugin, then click to `Install without restart`. Note: No need to install the other `Git plugin` which is already installed can be seen under `Installed` tab.
