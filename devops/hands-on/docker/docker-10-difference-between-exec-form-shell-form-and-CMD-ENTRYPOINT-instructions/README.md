# Hands-on Docker-10 : Difference between  `exec` form and `shell` form, and `CMD` instruction and `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give the students understanding to difference between:

- `exec` form and `shell` form  

- `CMD` instruction and `ENTRYPOINT` instruction 

## Learning Outcomes

- At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- Learn `exec` form and `shell` form. 

- Explain difference between `exec` form and `shell` form.

- Learn `CMD` instruction and `ENTRYPOINT` instruction.

- Explain difference between `CMD` instruction and `ENTRYPOINT` instruction.

- Use `CMD` instruction as a parameter of `ENTRYPOINT` instruction
 
## Outline

- Part 1 Difference between `exec` form and `shell` form

- Part 2 Difference between `CMD` instruction and `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

- Part 3 Use `CMD` instruction as a parameter of `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

## Part 1 Difference between `exec` form and `shell` form

- Create a folder and name it shell-exec-cmd-entrypoint.

```bash
mkdir shell-exec-cmd-entrypoint
cd shell-exec-cmd-entrypoint
```

- create a Dockerfile and input following statements.

```txt
FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "hello"
```

- Build an image from this Dockerfile and tag it as "cmd-shell:v1".

```bash
docker build -t cmd-shell:v1 .
```

- Run cmd-shell image.

```bash
docker run cmd-shell
hello
```

- Change the CMD line to exec form. For exec form, we change to shell script to JSON array form.

```txt
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "hello"]
# CMD echo "hello"
```

- Build an image from this Dockerfile and tag it as "cmd-exec:v1".

```bash
docker build -t cmd-exec .
```

- Run cmd-exec image.

```bash
docker run cmd-exec
hello
```

- It seems the same. What is the difference?

- Change the Dockerfile as below. This time, we input an environment variable instead of hello. 

```txt
FROM ubuntu
CMD echo $HOME

# CMD ["echo", "hello"]
# CMD echo "hello"
```

- Build an image from this Dockerfile and tag it as "cmd-shell:v2".

```bash
docker build -t cmd-shell:v2 .
```

- Run cmd-shell:v2 image.

```bash
docker run cmd-shell
/root
```

- Change the CMD line to exec form in Dockerfile.

```txt
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "$HOME"]

# CMD echo $HOME

# CMD ["echo", "hello"]
# CMD echo "hello"
```

- Build an image from this Dockerfile and tag it as "cmd-exec:v2".

```bash
docker build -t cmd-exec:v2 .
```

- Run cmd-exec:v2 image.

```bash
docker run cmd-exec:v2
$HOME
```

- This time, the output is changed. We couldn't learn `$HOME` environment variable. The reason is that: <br>
Unlike the shell form, the exec form does not invoke a command shell. So we couldn't reach environment variables.

## Part 2 Difference between `CMD` instruction and `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

- First, run the cmd-shell:v1 image with ls command.

```bash
docker run cmd-shell:v1 ls
```

- Notice that, we see list of `root(/) directory` instead of hello.

- Change the CMD line to ENTRYPOINT line in Dockerfile as below.

```txt
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT echo hello

# CMD ["echo", "$HOME"]
# CMD echo $HOME

# CMD ["echo", "hello"]
# CMD echo "hello"
```

- Build an image from this Dockerfile and tag it as "entrypoint:v1".

```bash
docker build -t entrypoint:v1 .
```

- Run `entrypoint:v1` image with ls command.

```bash
docker run entrypoint:v1 ls
hello
```

- Notice that we couldn't execute ls command. Because, unlike `CMD`, we can't override `ENTRYPOINT`.

## Part 3 Use `CMD` instruction as a parameter of `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

- Change the `ENTRYPOINT` line to exec form and add a `CMD` line.

```txt
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT [ "echo", "hello" ]
CMD [ "Joe" ]

#ENTRYPOINT echo hello

# CMD ["echo", "$HOME"]
# CMD echo $HOME

# CMD ["echo", "hello"]
# CMD echo "hello"
```

- Build an image from this Dockerfile and tag it as "entrypoint-cmd".

```bash
docker build -t entrypoint-cmd .
```

- Run the `entrypoint-cmd` image.

```bash
docker run entrypoint-cmd
hello Joe
```

- Now, run the `entrypoint-cmd` image as Below.

```bash
docker run entrypoint-cmd Osvaldo
hello Osvaldo
```

- Notice that we can override `CMD` instruction but we can not override `ENTRYPOINT` instruction.
