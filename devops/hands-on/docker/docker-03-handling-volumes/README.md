- Part 2 - Data Persistence in Docker Containers

- Part 3 - Managing Docker Volumes

- Part 4 - Using Same Volume with Different Containers

- Part 5 - docker volume behaviours

- Part 6 - Bind Mounts

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation](../docker-01-installing-on-ec2-linux2/docker-installation-template.yml).

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Part 2 - Data Persistence in Docker Containers

- Check if the docker service is up and running.

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

- Run a `alpine` container with interactive shell open, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, explain explain what the alpine container is and why it is so popular. (Small size, Secure, Simple, Fast boot)

```bash
docker run -it alpine ash
```

- Display the os release of the alpine container.

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

- Create a file named `short-life.txt` under `/home` folder

```bash
cd home && touch short-life.txt && ls
```

- Exit the container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Show the list of all containers available on Docker machine.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Start the alpine container and connect to it.

```bash
docker start 737 && docker attach 737
```

- Show that the file `short-life.txt` is still there, and explain why it is there. (Container holds it data until removed).

```bash
ls /home
```

- Exit the container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Remove the alpine container.

```bash
docker rm 737
```

- Show the list of all containers, and the alpine container is gone with its data.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

## Part 3 - Managing Docker Volumes

- Explain why we need volumes in Docker.

- List the volumes available in Docker, since not added volume before list should be empty.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

- Create a volume named `cw-vol`.

```bash
docker volume create cw-vol
```

- List the volumes available in Docker, should see local volume `cw-vol` in the list.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

- Show details and explain the volume `cw-vol`. Note the mount point: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/cw-vol/_data`.

```bash
docker volume inspect cw-vol
```

- List all files/folders under the mount point of the volume `cw-vol`, should see nothing listed.

```bash
sudo ls -al  /var/lib/docker/volumes/cw-vol/_data
```

- Run a `alpine` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `clarus`, attach the volume `cw-vol` to `/cw` mount point in the container, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, explain `--volume` and `v` flags.

```bash
docker run -it --name clarus -v cw-vol:/cw alpine ash
```

- List files/folder in `clarus` container, show mounting point `/cw`, and explain the mounted volume `cw-vol`.

```bash
ls
```

- Create a file in `clarus` container under `/cw` folder.

```bash
cd cw && echo "This file is created in the container Clarus" > i-will-persist.txt
```

- List the files in `/cw` folder, and show content of `i-will-persist.txt`.

```bash
ls && cat i-will-persist.txt
```

- Exit the `clarus` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Show the list of all containers available on Docker machine.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Remove the `clarus` container.

```bash
docker rm clarus
```

- Show the list of all containers, and the `clarus` container is gone.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- List all files/folders under the volume `cw-vol`, show that the file `i-will-persist.txt` is there.

```bash
sudo ls -al  /var/lib/docker/volumes/cw-vol/_data && sudo cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/cw-vol/_data/i-will-persist.txt
```

## Part 4 - Using Same Volume with Different Containers

- Run a `alpine` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `clarus2nd`, attach the volume `cw-vol` to `/cw2nd` mount point in the container, and add command to run alpine shell.

```bash
docker run -it --name clarus2nd -v cw-vol:/cw2nd alpine ash
```

- List the files in `/cw2nd` folder, and show that we can reach the file `i-will-persist.txt`.

```bash
ls -l /cw2nd && cat /cw2nd/i-will-persist.txt
```

- Create an another file in `clarus2nd` container under `/cw2nd` folder.

```bash
cd cw2nd && echo "This is a file of the container Clarus2nd" > loadmore.txt
```

- List the files in `/cw2nd` folder, and show content of `loadmore.txt`.

```bash
ls && cat loadmore.txt
```

- Exit the `clarus2nd` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Run a `ubuntu` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `clarus3rd`, attach the volume `cw-vol` to `/cw3rd` mount point in the container, and add command to run bash shell.

```bash
docker run -it --name clarus3rd -v cw-vol:/cw3rd ubuntu bash
```

- List the files in `/cw3rd` folder, and show that we can reach the all files created earlier.

```bash
ls -l /cw3rd
```

- Create an another file in `clarus3rd` container under `/cw3rd` folder.

```bash
cd cw3rd && touch file-from-3rd.txt && ls
```

- Exit the `clarus3rd` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- Run an another `ubuntu` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `clarus4th`, attach the volume `cw-vol` as read-only to `/cw4th` mount point in the container, and add command to run bash shell.

```bash
docker run -it --name clarus4th -v cw-vol:/cw4th:ro ubuntu bash
```

- List the files in `/cw4th` folder, and show that we can reach the all files created earlier.

```bash
ls -l /cw4th
```

- Try to create an another file under `/cw4th` folder. Should see error `read-only file system`

```bash
cd cw4th && touch file-from-4th.txt
```

- Exit the `clarus4th` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- List all containers.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Delete `clarus2nd`, `clarus3rd` and `clarus4th` containers.

```bash
docker rm clarus2nd clarus3rd clarus4th
```

- Delete `cw-vol` volume.

```bash
docker volume rm cw-vol
```

## Part 5 - docker volume behaviours

| Situation   | Behaviour |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| If there is no target directory. | The target directory is created and files inside volume are copied to this directory. |
| If there is target directory, but it is empty. | The files in volume are copied to target directory.  |
|If there is target directory and it is not empty, but volume is empty. | The files in the target directory are copied to volumes. |
| If volume is not empty. | We just see the files inside volume regardless of  the target directory is full or empty. |

- Create `empty-vol` and `full-vol` volumes.

```bash
docker volume create empty-vol
docker volume create full-vol
```

- Run an `alpine` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `vol-lesson`, attach the volume `full-vol` to `/cw` mount point in the container, and add command to run alpine shell. 

```bash
docker run -it --name vol-lesson -v full-vol:/cw alpine ash
```

- Create a file in `full-vol` container under `/cw` folder.

```bash
cd cw && echo "This file is created in the full-vol volume" > full.txt
```

- Exit the `vol-lesson` container and return to ec2-user bash shell.

```bash
exit
```

- List all files/folders under the volume `full-vol`, show that the file `full.txt` is there.

```bash
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/full-vol/_data
```

- Run the `clarusways/hello-clarus` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `clarus`, and show the inside of `hello-clarus` directory.

```bash
docker run -it --name clarus clarusways/hello-clarus sh
/ # ls
bin           etc           home          media         opt           root          sbin          sys           usr
dev           hello-clarus  lib           mnt           proc          run           srv           tmp           var
/ # cd hello-clarus && ls
app.py
```

- `exit` the container

### Situation-1:

| Situation   | Behaviour |
| ----------- | ----------- |
If there is no target directory. | The target directory is created and files inside volume are copied to this directory. |

- Run the `clarusways/hello-clarus` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `try1`, attach the volume `full-vol` to `/cw` mount point in the container, and show that `/cw` directory is created and files inside volume are copied to this directory.

```bash
docker run -it --name try1 -v full-vol:/cw clarusways/hello-clarus sh
/ # ls
bin           dev           hello-clarus  lib           mnt           proc          run           srv           tmp           var
cw            etc           home          media         opt           root          sbin          sys           usr
/ # cd cw && ls
full.txt
```

- `exit` the container


### Situation-2:

| Situation   | Behaviour |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|If there is target directory and it is not empty, but volume is empty. | The files in the target directory are copied to volumes. |

- List all files/folders under the volume `empty-vol`, show that the folder `is empty.

```bash
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/empty-vol/_data
```

- Run the `clarusways/hello-clarus` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `try2`, attach the volume `empty-vol` to `/hello-clarus` mount point in the container.

```bash
docker run -it --name try2 -v empty-vol:/hello-clarus clarusways/hello-clarus sh
/ # ls
bin           etc           home          media         opt           root          sbin          sys           usr
dev           hello-clarus  lib           mnt           proc          run           srv           tmp           var
/ # cd hello-clarus/ && ls
app.py
```

- List all files/folders under the `/hello-clarus`.

```bash
sudo ls /hello-clarus
app.py
```

- `exit` the container

- List all files/folders under the volume `empty-vol`, show that the file `app.py` is there.

```bash
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/empty-vol/_data
app.py
```

### Situation-3:

| Situation   | Behaviour |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| If volume is not empty. | We just see the files inside volume regardless of  the target directory is full or empty. |

- List all files/folders under the volume `full-vol`, show that the file `full.txt` is there.

```bash
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/full-vol/_data
full.txt
```

- Run the `clarusways/hello-clarus` container with interactive shell open, name the container as `try3`, attach the volume `full-vol` to `/hello-clarus` mount point in the container, and show that we just see the files inside volume regardless of  the target directory is full or empty.

```bash
docker run -it --name try3 -v full-vol:/hello-clarus clarusways/hello-clarus sh
/ # ls
bin           etc           home          media         opt           root          sbin          sys           usr
dev           hello-clarus  lib           mnt           proc          run           srv           tmp           var
/ # cd hello-clarus/ && ls
full.txt
```

- `exit` the container

```bash
docker container prune
docker volume prune
docker volume ls
docker container ls
```

## Part 6 - Bind Mounts

- Run the `nginx` container at the detached mod, name the container as `nginx-default`, and open <public-ip> on browser and show the nginx default page.

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx-default -p 80:80  nginx
```

- Attach the `nginx` container, show the index.html in the /usr/share/nginx/html directory.

```bash
docker exec -it nginx-default bash

```bash
mkdir webpage && cd webpage
echo "<h1>Welcome to Clarusway</h1>" > index.html
```

- Run the `nginx` container at the detached mod, name the container as `nginx-new`, attach the directory `/home/ec2-user/webpage` to `/usr/share/nginx/html` mount point in the container, and open <public-ip> on browser and show the web page.
