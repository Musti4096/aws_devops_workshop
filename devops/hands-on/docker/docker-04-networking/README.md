- create a network in Docker.

- inspect properties of a network in Docker.

- connect a container to a network.

- explain default network bridge configuration.

- configure user-defined network bridge.

- ping containers within same network.

- can bind containers to specific ports.

- delete Docker networks.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Part 2 - Default Network Bridge in Docker

- Part 3 - User-defined Network Bridge in Docker

- Part 4 - Container Networking

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation](../docker-01-installing-on-ec2-linux2/docker-installation-template.yml).

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Part 2 - Default Network Bridge in Docker

- Check if the docker service is up and running.

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

- List all networks available in Docker, and explain types of networks.

```bash
docker network ls
```

- Run two `alpine` containers with interactive shell, in detached mode, name the container as `clarus1st` and `clarus2nd`, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, explain what the detached mode means.

```bash
docker run -dit --name clarus1st alpine ash
docker run -dit --name clarus2nd alpine ash
```

- Show the list of running containers on Docker machine.

```bash
docker ps
```

- Show the details of `bridge` network, and explain properties (subnet, ips) and why containers are in the default network bridge.

```bash
docker network inspect bridge | less
```

- Get the IP of `clarus1st` container.

```bash
docker inspect clarus2nd |grep IPAddress
```


- Connect to the `clarus1st` container.

```bash
docker attach clarus1st
```

- Ping google.com four times to check internet connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

- Ping `clarus2nd `container by its IP four times to show the connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 172.17.0.3
```

- Try to ping `clarus2nd `container by its name, should face with bad address. Explain why failed (due to default bridge configuration not works with container names)

```bash
ping -c 4 clarus2nd
```

- Disconnect from `clarus1st` without stopping it (CTRL + p + q).

- Stop and delete the containers

```bash
docker stop clarus1st clarus2nd
docker rm clarus1st clarus2nd
```

## Part 3 - User-defined Network Bridge in Docker

- Create a bridge network `clarusnet`.

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge clarusnet
```

- List all networks available in Docker, and show the user-defined `clarusnet`.

```bash
docker network ls
```

- Show the details of `clarusnet`, and show that there is no container yet.

```bash
docker network inspect clarusnet
```

- Run four `alpine` containers with interactive shell, in detached mode, name the containers as `clarus1st`, `clarus2nd`, `clarus3rd` and `clarus4th`, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, 1st and 2nd containers should be in `clarusnet`, 3rd container should be in default network bridge, 4th container should be in both `clarusnet` and default network bridge.

```bash
docker run -dit --network clarusnet --name clarus1st alpine ash
docker run -dit --network clarusnet --name clarus2nd alpine ash
docker run -dit --name clarus3rd alpine ash
docker run -dit --name clarus4th alpine ash
docker network connect clarusnet clarus4th
```

- List all running containers and show there up and running.

```bash
docker container ls
```

- Show the details of `clarusnet`, and explain newly added containers. (1st, 2nd, and 4th containers should be in the list)

```bash
docker network inspect clarusnet
```

- Show the details of  default network bridge, and explain newly added containers. (3rd and 4th containers should be in the list)

```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

- Connect to the `clarus1st` container.

```bash
docker attach clarus1st
```

- Ping `clarus2nd` and `clarus4th` container by its name to show that in user-defined network, container names can be used in networking.

```bash
ping -c 4 clarus2nd
ping -c 4 clarus4th
```

- Try to ping `clarus3rd` container by its name and IP, should face with bad address because 3rd container is in different network.

```bash
ping -c 4 clarus3rd
ping -c 4 172.17.0.2
```

- Ping google.com to check internet connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

- Exit the `clarus1st` container without stopping and return to ec2-user bash shell.

- Connect to the `clarus4th` container, since it is in both network should connect all containers.

```bash
docker attach clarus4th
```

- Ping `clarus2nd` and `clarus4th` container by its name, ping `clarus3rd` container with its IP. Explain why used IP, instead of name.

```bash
ping -c 4 clarus1st
ping -c 4 clarus2nd
ping -c 4 172.17.0.2
```

- Stop and remove all containers

```bash
docker stop clarus1st clarus2nd clarus3rd clarus4th
docker rm clarus1st clarus2nd clarus3rd clarus4th
```

- Delete `clarusnet` network

```bash
docker network rm clarusnet
```

## Part 4 - Container Networking

- Run a `nginx` web server, name the container as `ng`, and bind the web server to host port 8080 command to run alpine shell. Explain `--rm` and `-p` flags and port binding.

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name ng nginx
```

- Add a security rule for protocol HTTP port 8080 and show Nginx Web Server is running on Docker Machine.

```text
http://ec2-18-232-70-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080
```

- Stop container `ng`, should be removed automatically due to `--rm` flag.

```bash
docker stop ng
```
