## Part 1 - Launch Docker Machine Instances and Connect with SSH

- Launch `five` Compose enabled Docker machines on Amazon Linux 2 with security group allowing SSH connections using the of [Clarusway Docker Swarm Cloudformation Template](./clarusway-docker-swarm-cfn-template.yml).

- Connect to your instances with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Part 2 - Set up a Swarm Cluster with Manager and Worker Nodes

- Prerequisites (Those prerequisites are satisfied within cloudformation template in Part 1)

  - Five EC2 instances on Amazon Linux 2 with `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed.

  - Set these ingress rules on your EC2 security groups:

    - HTTP port 80 from 0.0.0.0\0

    - TCP port 2377 from 0.0.0.0\0

    - TCP port 8080 from 0.0.0.0\0

    - SSH port 22 from 0.0.0.0\0 (for increased security replace this with your own IP)

- Initialize `docker swarm` with Private IP and assign your first docker machine as manager:

```bash
docker swarm init
# or
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Private IPs>
```

- Check if the `docker swarm` is active or not.

```bash
docker info
```

- Get the manager token with `docker swarm join-token manager` command.

```bash
docker swarm join-token manager
```

- Add second and third Docker Machine instances as manager nodes, by connecting with SSH and running the given command above.

```bash
docker swarm join --token <manager_token> <manager_ip>:2377
```

- Add fourth and fifth Docker Machine instances as worker nodes. (Run `docker swarm join-token worker` command to get join-token for worker, if needed)

```bash
docker swarm join --token <worker_token> <manager_ip>:2377
```

- List the connected nodes in `Swarm`.

```bash
docker node ls
```

## Part 3 - Using Overlay Network in Docker Swarm

- List Docker networks and explain overlay network (ingress)

```bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect ingress
```

- Create a user defined overlay network.

```bash
docker network create -d overlay clarus-net
```

- Explain user-defined overlay network (clarus-net)

```bash
docker network inspect clarus-net
```

- Create a new service with 3 replicas.

```bash
docker service create --name webserver --network clarus-net -p 80:80 -d --replicas=3 clarusways/container-info:1.0
```

- List the tasks of `webserver` service, detect the nodes which is running the task and which is not.

```bash
docker service ps webserver
```

- Check the URLs of nodes that is running the task with `http://<ec2-public-hostname-of-node>` in the browser and show that the app is accessible, and explain `Container Info` on the app page. (`Host` is the name of container hosting the app, `Network Information` is giving IP addresses attached to `container` by different networks, for example;  `10.0.1.3 from clarus-net`, `172.18.0.3 from docker_gwbridge`, `10.0.0.8 from ingress network`  )

- Check the URLs of nodes that is not running the task with `http://<ec2-public-hostname-of-node>` in the browser and show that the app is not accessible.

- Add following rules to security group of the nodes to enable the ingress network in the swarm and explain `swarm routing mesh`. *All nodes participate in an `ingress routing mesh`. The `routing mesh` enables each node in the `swarm` to accept connections on published ports for any service running in the swarm, **even if thereâ€™s no task running on the node**. The routing mesh routes all incoming requests to published ports on available nodes to an active container.* [Using swarm mode routing mesh](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/ingress/#bypass-the-routing-mesh)

  - For container network discovery -> Protocol: TCP,  Port: 7946, Source: security group itself

  - For container network discovery -> Protocol: UDP,  Port: 7946, Source: security group itself

  - For the container ingress network -> Protocol: UDP,  Port: 4789, Source: security group itself

- Check the URLs of nodes that is not running the task with `http://<ec2-public-hostname-of-node>` in the browser and show that the app is **now** accessible.

- Create a service for `clarusways/for-ping` and connect it clarus-net.

```bash
docker service create --name for_ping --network clarus-net clarusways/for-ping
```

- List services

```bash
docker service ls
```

- List the tasks and go to terminal of ec2-instance which is running `for_ping` task.

```bash
docker service ps for_ping
```

- List the containers in ec2-instance which is running `for_ping` task.

```bash
docker container ls
```

- Connect the `for_ping` container.

```bash
docker container exec -it <container_id> sh
```

- Ping the webserver service and explain DNS resolution. (When we ping the `Service Name`, it returns Virtual IP of `webserver`).

```bash
ping webserver
```

- Explain the `load balancing` with the curl command. (Pay attention to the host when input `curl http://webserver` )

```bash
curl http://webserver
```

- Remove the services.

```bash
docker service rm webserver for_ping
```

## Part 4 - Managing Sensitive Data with Docker Secrets

- Explain [how to manage sensitive data with Docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/).

- Create two files named `name.txt` and `password.txt`.

```bash
echo "User" > name.txt
echo "clarus123@" > password.txt
```

- Create docker secrets for both.

```bash
docker secret create username ./name.txt
docker secret create userpassword ./password.txt
```

- List docker secrets.

```bash
docker secret ls
```

- Create a new service with secrets.

```bash
docker service create -d --name secretdemo --secret username --secret userpassword clarusways/container-info:1.0
```

- List the tasks and go to terminal of ec2-instance which is running `secretdemo` task.

```bash
docker service ps secretdemo
```

- Connect the `secretdemo` container and show the secrets.

```bash
docker container exec -it <container_id> sh
cd /run/secrets
ls
cat username
cat userpassword
```

- To update the secrets; create another secret using `standard input` and remove the old one.(We can't update the secrets.)

```bash
echo "qwert@123" | docker secret create newpassword -
docker service update --secret-rm userpassword --secret-add newpassword secretdemo
```

- To check the updated secret, list the tasks and go to terminal of ec2-instance which is running `secretdemo` task.

```bash
docker service ps secretdemo
```

- Connect the `secretdemo` container and show the secrets.

```bash
docker container exec -it <container_id> sh
cd /run/secrets
ls
cat newpassword
```

## Part 5 - Managing Docker Stack

- Explain `Docker Stack`.

- Create a folder for the project and change into your project directory
  
```bash
mkdir todoapi
cd todoapi
```

- Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project folder with following setup and explain it.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
    database:
        image: mysql:5.7
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: R1234r
            MYSQL_DATABASE: todo_db
            MYSQL_USER: clarusway
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: Clarusway_1
        networks:
            - clarusnet
    myapp:
        image: clarusways/to-do-api:latest
        deploy:
            replicas: 5
        depends_on:
            - database
        ports:
            - "80:80"
        networks:
            - clarusnet

networks:

```bash
docker stack ls
```

- List the services in the stack.

```bash
docker stack services clarus-todoapi
```

- Remove stacks.

```bash
docker stack rm clarus-todoapi
```

## Part 6 - Running WordPress as a Docker Stack

- Create a folder for the project and change into your project directory
  
```bash
mkdir wordpress
cd wordpress
```

- Create a file called `wp_password.txt` containing a password in your project folder.

```bash
echo "Kk12345" > wp_password.txt
```

- Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project folder with following setup and explain it.

```yaml

            replicas: 3
            update_config:
                parallelism: 2
                delay: 5s
                order: start-first
        environment:
            WORDPRESS_DB_USER: clarusway
            WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/wp_password
