# Hands-on VPC-03 : 

## Part 5 - Creating VPC peering between two VPCs (Default and Custom one)

## STEP 1 : Prep---> Launching Instances


- Launch two Instances. First instance will be in "clarus-az1a-private-subnet" of "clarus-vpc-a",and the other one will be in your "Default VPC". 

- In addition, since the private EC2 needs internet connectivity to set user data, we also need NAT Gateway.

### A. Configure Public Windows instance in **Default VPC.

```text
AMI             : Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base
Instance Type   : t2.micro
Network         : **Default VPC
Subnet          : Default Public Subnet
Security Group  : 
    Sec.Group Name : WindowsSecGrb
    Rules          : RDP --- > 3389 ---> Anywhere
Tag             :
    Key         : Name
    Value       : Windows public

PS: For MAC, "Microsoft Remote Desktop" program should be installed on the computer.
```
### B. Since we need http connection we need to change Private Sec.Grb.

Security Group    : 
    Sec.Group Name : Private Sec.group
    Rules          : All Traffic ---> 0.0.0.0.0/0

### C. Since the private EC2 needs internet connectivity to set user data, we use NAT Gateway

- Click Create Nat Gateway button in left hand pane on VPC menu

- click Create NAT Gateway.

```bash
Name                      : clarus-nat-gateway-2

Subnet                    : clarus-az1a-public-subnet

Elastic IP allocation ID  : Second Elastic IP
```
- click "Create Nat Gateway" button

### D. Modify Route Table of Private Instance's Subnet

- Go to VPC console on left hand menu and select Route Table tab

- Select "clarus-private-rt" ---> Routes ----> Edit Rule ---> Add Route
```
Destination     : 0.0.0.0/0
Target ----> Nat Gateway ----> clarus-nat-gateway-2
```
- click save routes

WARNING!!! ---> Be sure that NAT Gateway is in active status. Since the private EC2 needs internet connectivity to set user data, NAT Gateway must be ready.

### E. Configure Private instance in 'clarus-az1a-private-subnet' of 
'clarus-vpc-a'.

```text
AMI             : Amazon Linux 2
Instance Type   : t2.micro
Network         : clarus-vpc-a 
Subnet          : clarus-az1a-private-subnet
user data       : 

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
amazon-linux-extras install nginx1.12
yum install -y wget
chkconfig nginx on
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
chmod o+w /usr/share/nginx/html
rm index.html
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awsdevopsteam/route-53/master/index.html
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awsdevopsteam/route-53/master/ken.jpg
service nginx start

Security Group    : 
    Sec.Group Name : Private Sec.group
    
Tag             :
    Key         : Name
    Value       : Private WEB EC2 

```

- Go to instance named 'Windows public' and push the connect button ----> Download Remote Desktop File

- Decrypt your ".pem key" using "Get Password" button
  - Push "Get Password" button
  - Select your pem key using "Choose File" button ----> Push "Decrypt Password" button
  - copy your Password and paste it "Windows Remote Desktop" program as a "administrator password"

- Open the internet explorer of windows machine and paste the private IP of EC2 named 'Private EC2 for peering'

- It is not able to connect to the website 


## STEP 2: Setting up Peering


- Go to 'Peering connections' menu on the left hand side pane of VPC

- Push "Create Peering Connection" button

```text
Peering connection name tag : First Peering
VPC(Requester)              : Default VPC
Account                     : My Account
Region                      : This Region (us-east-1)
VPC (Accepter)              : Clarus-vpc-a
```
- Hit "Create peering connection" button

- Select 'First Peering' ----> Action ---> Accept Request ----> Accept Request

- Go to route Tables and select default VPC's route table ----> Routes ----> Edit routes
```
Destination: paste "clarus-vpc-a" CIDR blok
Target ---> peering connection ---> select 'First Peering' ---> Save routes
```

- select clarus-private-rt's route table ----> Routes ----> 
Edit routes
```
Destination: paste "default VPC" CIDR blok
Target ---> peering connection ---> select 'First Peering' ---> Save routes
```

- Go to windows EC2 named 'Windows public', write IP address on browser and show them to website with KEN..


WARNING!!! ---> Please do not terminate "NAT Gateway" and "Private WEB EC2" for next part.


## Part 6 - Create VPC Endpoint

# STEP 1: Prep

Security Group    : 
    Sec.Group Name : Private Sec.group
    Rules          : All Traffic ---> Public Sec.Grb


### A. Create S3 Bucket 

- Go to the S3 service on AWS console
- Create a bucket of `clarusway-vpc-endpoint` with following properties, 

```text
Versioning                  : Disabled
Server access logging       : Disabled
Tagging                     : 0 Tags
Object-level logging        : Disabled
Default encryption          : None
CloudWatch request metrics  : Disabled
Object lock                 : Disabled
Block all public access     : unchecked
```
- upload 'Guile.png' and 'Honda.png' files into the S3 bucket

### B. Configure Public Instance (Bastion Host)

```text
AMI             : Amazon Linux 2
Instance Type   : t2.micro
Network         : clarus-vpc-a
Subnet          : clarus-az1b-public-subnet
Security Group  : 
    Sec.Group Name : Public Sec.Group
    Rules          : TCP --- > 22 ---> Anywhere
                     All ICMP IPv4  ---> Anywhere
                     HTTp--------> Anywhere
Tag             :
    Key         : Name
    Value       : Public EC2 (Bastion Host)
```

### C. Create IAM role to reach S3 from "Private WEB EC2"

- Go to IAM Service from AWS console and select roles on left hand pane

- click create role
```
use case : EC2 ---> Next : Permission
Policy ---> "AmazonS3FullAccess" ---> Next
Role Name : clarusS3FullAccessforEndpoint
Role escription: clarus S3 Full Access for Endpoint
click create button
```
Go to EC2 service from AWS console

Select "Private WEB EC2" ---> Actions ---> Instance Settings ---> Attach/Replace IAM Role select newly created IAM role named 'clarusS3FullAccessforEndpoint' ---> Apply

# STEP 2: Connect S3 Bucket from Private WEB Instance

### A. Connect to the Bastion host

- Go to terminal and connect to the Bastion host named 'Public EC2 (Bastion Host)'

- Using Bastion host connect to the EC2 instance in "private subnet" named 'Private WEB EC2 ' (using ssh agent or copying directly pem key into the EC2)

- go to your local terminal

- add your private key to the ssh agent on your localhost
```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]
```
- run the ssh agent if it is returning error like "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent"
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
```
-  try again to add your private key to the ssh agent
```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]
```
- connect to the ec2-in-az1a-public-sn instance in public subnet
```bash
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-3-88-199-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
### B.Connect to the Private Instance

- once logged into the bastion host connect to 
the private instance in the private subnet:
```bash
ssh ec2-user@[Your private EC2 private IP]
```
### C. Use CLI to verify connectivity

- list the bucket in S3 and content of S3 bucket named "aws s3 ls "clarusway-vpc-endpoint" via following command

```
aws s3 ls
aws s3 ls clarusway-vpc-endpoint
```
- go to private route table named "clarus-private-rt" on VPC service

- select routes sub-menu ---> Edit routes ---> Delete "Peering and NAT Gateway"

- Go to the terminal and try to connect again S3 bucket via following command
```
aws s3 ls
```
- show that you are "not able to connect" to the s3 buckets list


## STEP 3: Create Endpoint

### A. Connect  to S3 via Endpoint

- go to the Endpoints menu on left hand pane in VPC

- click Create Endpoint
```text
Service Category : AWS services
Service Name     : com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3
VPC              : clarus-vpc-a
Route Table      : choose private one or both 
```
- Create Endpoint

- Go to private route table named 'clarus-private-rt' and show the endpoint rule that is automatically created by AWS 

### B. Connect  to S3 via Endpoint

- Go to terminal, list the buckets in S3 and content of S3 bucket named "aws s3 ls 
"clarusway-vpc-endpoint" via following command
```bash
aws s3 ls
aws s3 ls clarusway-vpc-endpoint
```

- copy the 'Guile.png' and 'Honda.png' files from S3 bucket into the private EC2
```bash
aws s3 cp s3://clarusway-vpc-endpoint/Guile.png .
aws s3 cp s3://clarusway-vpc-endpoint/Honda.png .
```

## Part 7 - Configuring NACL

## Step 1 :

- Go to the 'Network ACLs' menu from left hand pane on VPC

- click 'Create Network ACL' button
```
Name Tag      :clarus-private1a-nacl
VPC           :clarus-vpc-a
```
- Select Inbound Rules ---> Edit Inbound rules ---> Add Rule
```text
  Rule        Type              Protocol      Port Range        Source      Allow/Deny
  100         ssh(22)           TCP(6)        22                0.0.0.0/0   Allow
  200         All ICMP - IPv4   ICMP(1)       ALL               0.0.0.0/0   Allow
```

- Select Outbound Rules ---> Edit Inbound rules ---> Add Rule
```text
  Rule        Type              Protocol      Port Range        Destination      Allow/Deny
  100         ssh(22)           TCP(6)        22                0.0.0.0/0         Allow
  200         All ICMP - IPv4   ICMP(1)       ALL               0.0.0.0/0         Deny
```

- In the  NACL menu, select Subnet associations sub-menu ---> Edit subnet association ---> select "clarus-az1a-private-subnet" ---> edit

## Step 2 :

- go to terminal and try to connect the private EC2 with bastion host and show that there is no connectivity with ssh ---> explain ephemeral port

- go to your local terminal

- add your private key to the ssh agent on your localhost
```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]
```
- run the ssh agent if it is returning error like "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent"
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
```
-  try again to add your private key to the ssh agent
```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]
```
- connect to the ec2-in-az1a-public-sn instance in public subnet
```bash
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-3-88-199-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
- once logged into the bastion host connect to 
the private instance in the private subnet:
```bash
ssh ec2-user@[Your private EC2 private IP]
```
## Step 3 :

- using ping command, try to ping private EC2
```bash
ping [private EC2 Ip Address]
```

- go to the NACL table named "clarus-private1a-nacl"

- Select Outbound Rules ---> Edit Inbound rules ---> Add Rule

```text
  Rule        Type              Protocol      Port Range        Destination      Allow/Deny
  100         ssh(22)           TCP(6)        22                0.0.0.0/0         Allow
  200         All ICMP - IPv4   ICMP(1)       ALL               0.0.0.0/0         Deny 
  |                                         |                                   |
  |                                         |                                   |
  V                                         V                                   V
  100         Custom TCP Rule   TCP(6)      ""32768 - 65535""   0.0.0.0/0          Allow
  200         All ICMP - IPv4   ICMP(1)       ALL               0.0.0.0/0         ""Allow""
```
- click save, go to the terminal and reconnect to the private EC2

- using ping command, try to ping again to the private EC2
```bash
ping [private EC2 Ip Address]
```
