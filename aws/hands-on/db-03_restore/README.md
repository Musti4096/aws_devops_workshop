```
### STEP 1 - Installing MariaDB-client on Ubuntu Instance

- Launch EC2 Instance.

```text
AMI: Ubuntu 18.04
Instance Type: t2.micro

Security Group
  - SSH           -----> 22    -----> Anywhere
  - MYSQL/Aurora  -----> 3306  -----> Anywhere

```

- Connect Ubuntu Instance with SSH.

- Update instance.

```bash
sudo apt update -y

```

- Install the `mariadb-client`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install mariadb-client -y
```

### STEP 2 - Connecting to RDS DB Instance


- Connect the RDS MySQL DB instance with admin user, and paste the password when prompted.

```bash
mysql -h Your RDS Endpoint -u admin -p
```

- Show default databases in the MySQL server.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

- Choose a database 

```sql
USE clarusway;
```

- Show tables within the `clarusway` db.

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

- Show current users defined in the RDS DB instance.

```sql
SELECT Host, User, authentication_string FROM user;
```

### STEP 3 - Creating Tables in RDS DB Instance and Populating with Data


- Create a table named `offices` in clarusway database

```sql
CREATE TABLE `offices` (
  `office_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `address` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `city` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `state` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`office_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

- Insert sample data into the table named `offices` in clarusway database

```sql
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (1,'03 Reinke Trail','Cincinnati','OH');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (2,'5507 Becker Terrace','New York City','NY');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (3,'54 Northland Court','Richmond','VA');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (4,'08 South Crossing','Cincinnati','OH');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (5,'553 Maple Drive','Minneapolis','MN');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (6,'23 North Plaza','Aurora','CO');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (7,'9658 Wayridge Court','Boise','ID');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (8,'9 Grayhawk Trail','New York City','NY');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (9,'16862 Westend Hill','Knoxville','TN');
INSERT INTO `offices` VALUES (10,'4 Bluestem Parkway','Savannah','GA');
```

- Create a table named `employees`in clarusway database

```sql
CREATE TABLE `employees` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `first_name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `job_title` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `salary` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `reports_to` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `office_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`),
  KEY `fk_employees_offices_idx` (`office_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_employees_offices` FOREIGN KEY (`office_id`) REFERENCES `offices` (`office_id`) ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

- Insert sample data into the table named `employees`in clarusway database

```sql
INSERT INTO `employees` VALUES (37270,'Yovonnda','Magrannell','Executive Secretary',63996,NULL,10);
INSERT INTO `employees` VALUES (33391,'Darcy','Nortunen','Account Executive',62871,37270,1);

```

- Show newly created tables.

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

- List all records within `employees` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM offices;
```

- List all records within `offices` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

- Close the `clarusway` database terminal.

```sql
EXIT;
```

- For `point in time recovery` PART (PART-4), please note down the current time. (Exp: August 12, 2020, 22:45:34, UTC +3) and let the students know:

     -enter the time:14 03 30

## Part 2 - Taking a Snapshot from RDS DB Instance

- Take a manual snapshot of RDS instance and name it as `manual-snapshot-RDS-mysql`.

  - Go to Amazon RDS from AWS Console.

  - Select `RDS-mysql` database ---> Action -----> Take Snapshot

  - Settings:

  ```text

  DB Instance: RDS-mysql
  Snapshot name : Manual-Snapshot-RDS-Mysql
  ```
  - Create
  

## Part 3 - Recovering RDS DB Instance from Manual Snapshot

- Connect to RDS DB instance from MariaDB Client. Note: We need to delete some data to simulate the data lost.

- Login back to the RDS MySQL DB instance (`RDS-mysql`) as `admin` using the password defined with SSL pass: `Pl123456789`.

```bash
mysql -h RDS_ENDPOINT -u admin -p
```
- Choose a database 

```sql
USE clarusway;
```

  - Delete `employees` who earns salary above `$70000` from the `clarusway` db on `RDS-mysql`.

    - Show all data in `employee` table.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees;
    ```

    - Delete `employees` who have salary above `$70000`:

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;
    ```

    - Show that records left in `employees` tables are the ones who have salary lower than $70000. 

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees;

    There are only 7 personal now.
    ```

- Restore database from manual snapshot as new DB instance and name it as `restored-from-man-snapshot`.

  - Go to snapshot on left hand menu and select snapshot named `manual-snapshot-RDS-mysql`.

  - Click Action ----> Restore snapshot.

  ```text
  - DB specifications:
    Engine : MySQL Community

  - Settings:
    DB Instance identifier : restored-from-man-snapshot

  - Connectivity:
    Virtual private cloud (VPC)Info: Default

  - Additional connectivity configuration:
    Subnet Group : Default
    Public Accessible: Yes
    Existing VPC security groups: DatabaseSecGrb

  - DB instance size:(System changed it automatically to the Standard classes) 
    ***Select Burstable classes (includes t classes)
    ***t2.micro

  - Storage:
    General Purpose SSD
    Allocated storage : 20 GiB

  - Availability & durability:
    Do not create standby Instance
    Availability Zone: No preference

  - Database authentication:
    Password authentication

  - Encryption:
    Keep it as is

  - Additional configuration:
    Keep it as is
  ```

- This time we are going to connect as `admin` using the password defined `Pl123456789` to the newly RDS Instance named `restored-from-man-snapshot` that is created from snapshot.

```bash
mysql -h [***restored-from-man-snapshot RDS endpoint] -u admin -p
```

- Choose a database (`clarusway` db) to work with.

```sql
USE clarusway;
```

- Show tables within the `clarusway` db.

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

- Show that deleted records of employees are back in `restored-from-man-snapshot`

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
- Exit from`restored-from-man-snapshot` database

```sql
EXIT;
```
## Part 4 - Restoring RDS DB Instance from a "Point in Time"

- Connect to the 'RDS-Mysql` database again.

```bash
mysql -h [RDS-MysqlENDPOINT] -u admin -p
```
- Choose a database 

```sql
USE clarusway;
```

- This time, delete `employees` who earn salary above `$60000` from the `clarusway` db on `RDS-Mysql`.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000;
```
- Show the data in employees table

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;

there are only 4 records 
```
- To rescue the data we'll Restore database from the "point in time snapshot" that will be named as `restored-from-point-in-time-RDS`.

  - Go to Amazon RDS console and select `RDS-Mysql` database.

  ```text
  Actions ---> Restore to point in time
  ```

  - Launch DB Instance.

  ```text
  - Restore Time
    Custom ----> Enter the exact time that you wrote down at the end of the PART-1

  ```

- Go to the MariaDB Client instance.

- Log into the RDS instance (`restored-from-point-in-time-RDS`) as `admin` using the password defined `Pl123456789`

```bash
mysql -h [DNS Name of point in time recovery RDS Instance] -u admin -p clarusway
```

- Show that deleted records of employees are back in `restored-from-point-in-time-RDS`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary ASC;
```

## Part 5 - Dumping and Migrating Database

- Show that some information are absent in the `clarusway` database on RDS DB instance (`RDS-Mysql`). We need to recover absent data from snapshot via dumping.

- Go to MariaDB Client instance by connecting with SSH.

- Back up the `clarusway` db from RDS DB instance (`restored-from-point-in-time-RDS`) to the file named `backup.sql` on EC2 instance.

```bash
mysqldump -h [restored-from-point-in-time-RDS endpoint] -u admin -p clarusway > backup.sql
```

- Show `backup.sql` file with `ls` command.

- Connect to `RDS-Mysql` RDS DB Instance.

```bash
mysql -h [RDS-mysql endpoint] -u admin -p
```

- Create a database named `migration` on the `RDS-Mysql` instance.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE migration;
EXIT;
```

- Restore the backup of `clarusway` db on to the MySQL DB Server (`RDS-mysql` instance) using  `backup.sql` file

```bash
mysql -h [RDS-mysql endpoint] -u admin -p migration < backup.sql
```

- Connect to the `RDS-mysql` instance.

```bash
mysql -h [RDS-mysql endpoint] -u admin -p;
```

- Show that all records are replicated in the `migration` database.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
USE migration;
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
